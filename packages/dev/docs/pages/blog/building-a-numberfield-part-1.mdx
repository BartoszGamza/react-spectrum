# Building a NumberField Part 1: Why not native
Started with reading https://technology.blog.gov.uk/2020/02/24/why-the-gov-uk-design-system-team-changed-the-input-type-for-numbers/ thanks @deebov
which goes into greater depth on these topics
## Accessibility issues
    // this is short section restating some of what's in the blog as a TL;DR type of thing
  - input type number / role spinbutton is not selectable by some dictation/sr software
  - may appear unlabeled
  - rounding
  - scrolling

## Differences in conclusions drawn
  ### Pattern
    - we don't limit text via pattern, we use beforeinput (more in part 2)
    - we don't currently tackle the issue of telling a user what character set they are bound to using
    - we wouldn't use a NumberField for things like credit cards
  ### Role
    - text with roledescription of NumberField
  ### Inputmode
    - The things we did to show mobile keyboards, deal with minus signs
  - Formatting control
  - How we handle stepping, handling rounding errors, etc.
  - scrolling only enabled when focused, maybe also completely turned off
  - disabling focus on stepper buttons and where focus goes


Other things of interest
Bug disabling form elements while over them (stepper buttons)


# Building a NumberField Part 2: Intro to numbering systems
  ## What is a numbering system
  ### How do numbering systems work with locales
    - -u-nu-
    - differences when combined
  ## Manipulating numbers // maybe different title?
  ### Formatting
    - Intl NumberFormat
  ### Parsing
    - combined numbering system and locale with formatting
    - what to do about special characters like arab decimal character
    - always allowing certain characters like 'minus' even in accounting where parens are expected
  ## How do we handle input method editors
    - pinyin & composition events
